abstract = {MFEM is an open-source, lightweight, flexible and scalable C++ library for modular finite element methods that features arbitrary high-order finite element meshes and spaces, support for a wide variety of discretization approaches and emphasis on usability, portability, and high-performance computing efficiency. MFEM’s goal is to provide application scientists with access to cutting-edge algorithms for high-order finite element meshing, discretizations and linear solvers, while enabling researchers to quickly and easily develop and test new algorithms in very general, fully unstructured, high-order, parallel and GPU-accelerated settings. In this paper we describe the underlying algorithms and finite element abstractions provided by MFEM, discuss the software implementation, and illustrate various applications of the library.}
